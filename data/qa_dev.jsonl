{"id": "wp013", "doc_id": "whitepaper", "question": "How does the whitepaper differentiate .ai and .agent AI-Name extensions?", "ground_truth_answer": ".ai indicates a human or organization is accountable; .agent indicates an autonomous service (which can be anchored to an enterprise as part of its workforce).", "ground_truth_citations": ["zCloak_AI_Whitepaper_v1.4.pdf p12"]}
{"id": "wp014", "doc_id": "whitepaper", "question": "What is a workforce table in an enterprise AI-Profile, and what does it list?", "ground_truth_answer": "It lists the organization’s Avatars and agents (e.g., sales/support Avatars and autonomous agents), linking them to the enterprise identity.", "ground_truth_citations": ["zCloak_AI_Whitepaper_v1.4.pdf p12"]}
